# Vault

Vault is a command-line tool designed to create file Vaults on your file system.

The `SPECIFICATION.md` file lists the implementation guidence I will be following for the CLI.

Also Documentation for usage will come. The intent is to use the GitHub Wiki for the documentation. There will be a link to it here when that is a thing.

### Disclaimer

The plan is to make Vault an on-going project, to apply new knowlege and skills to make Vault the best it can be. However, I am working alone on this, so it may take me some time to get Vault off the ground, and to a V1.

Also, feel free to review my code, and suggest improvements to it. I am grateful for any improvements anyone can provide.
